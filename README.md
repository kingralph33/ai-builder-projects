# 🧠 AI Builder Projects

Welcome! This is my personal repository documenting my journey toward becoming a high-level AI/ML engineer and builder. It includes hands-on experiments, foundational learning, and applied projects using machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs).

---

## 🚀 Roadmap & Goals

- 📚 Master the fundamentals of Computer Science and Math
- 🤖 Build and deploy machine learning models using Python, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- 💬 Explore and experiment with LLMs and GenAI tools (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain)
- 🛠️ Learn MLOps and infrastructure: FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud deployments
- 🧱 Build real, scalable AI applications
