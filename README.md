# 🧠 AI Builder Projects

This is my repository documenting my journey to becoming an AI/ML engineer and builder. It includes hands-on experiments, applied machine learning projects, and GenAI applications using Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Hugging Face, and modern ML infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- 🤖 Build and deploy ML models with Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- 💬 Explore and experiment with large language models (LLMs) via OpenAI, Hugging Face, and LangChain
- 🛠️ Learn MLOps tools and deployment strategies (FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS)
- 🧪 Ship real AI projects and tools — not just notebooks
